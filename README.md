This is a project I created using Python as part of my data science course. The main goal of the project is to predict property prices based on a dataset of real estate features like property type, location, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

The project includes four main steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data by filling in missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing numeric data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data using statistics and visualizations to understand patterns, spot outliers, and explore relationships between features.
Model Development: Building and testing machine learning models to make predictions, while identifying the most important features.
Model Evaluation: Checking how well the model performs using accuracy metrics like MAE and RMSE and adjusting settings to improve results.
This project showcases a clear and organized approach to working with data and building a reliable property price prediction tool.
